Now this file will record my progress

---------------- Thu, 16 Mar 23: 12:39PM

I was creating a CheckCollision function and

---------------- Fri, 17 Mar 23: 08:23PM

Now I think I finished Snake class

---------------- Sun, 19 Mar 23: 09:00PM

I think i implemented to render method in World class but not yet check the error or debug at all

---------------- Mon, 20 Mar 23: 11:56AM

I finished implementing World class, Now I 'm starting to create Game class
        (Still, I haven't build or debug yet, all the errors I got so far
        is from c/c++ intellisense extension of vscode)

---------------- Tue, 21 Mar 23: 09:07AM
                 I keep creating more class, this time is Game class
                 

---------------- Tue, 21 Mar 23: 11:35AM
                 I think I Finished Game Class. Time to compile and debug

---------------- Wed, 22 Mar 23: 02:18PM

                 I 've been debugging, I think I nearly done!For some reason
                 The window appear with the snake in it, but it crashed right
                 after appear. I think I still have a lot of things to do more.

---------------- Wed, 22 Mar 23: 09:04PM

                 I got rid of all bugs and possible warnings. But some how the game crashed right after open. From what were showed, I saw that there were no horizontal bars, and the fruit was first generated right inside the left bar. May be bugs are some where in the implementation of World class where the fruit and bars objects implemented.

                 I think I implemented World class properly. Cause I debugged and didn't see anythings strange. Maybe the bugs is sth outside the book. I solved the horizontal bars problem but not yet fix the fruit position. I'm still fixing it.

---------------- Fri, 24 Mar 23: 02:24PM

I solved the fruit init position, but the snake disppear and the loop stuck thing still be unsolved. I'm working toward it.

---------------- Fri, 24 Mar 23: 09:33PM

I think the loop stuck is related to elapsed time or something related to sf::Time. I'm running out of time today, I will keep debugging tommorrow.

---------------- Tue, 28 Mar 23: 08:57AM

                 Based on what I saw in the game's window, There wasn't any snake at all. The thing is I used to see it in first debug.  But after a few changes in code, I unintentionally cause it disappeared. I guess the problem is in the Snake class, especially in constructor.
                 I dipped into Snake class, I even compared it to the example but I saw nothing. The problem may lied in other class(files).

---------------- Mon, 03 Apr 23: 08:25AM

                 I done inspect the World class and compare to the original code
                 and I didn't see any differences. Now I move on to the game class and keep comparing, this is the only efficient way, This game project seem new to me.I saw the difference between my elapsed time method to compare with the original code. I think this is the main problem of the game loop stuck things.I came across with many other problems, none of related to loop stuck and snake disappearing things.By the way, I've done inspect Snake class and compare with example code.

---------------- Thu, 06 Apr 23: 09:03AM

                 I Think I solved the disappearing snake (cause is I initiated snake class before, world class while world class contain argument for class snake to start so class snake lack of m_size(graphic size to initiate properly)).Still, I 've not figure out why the game loop stuck.

---------------- Thu, 06 Apr 23: 12:47PM

                 For some reason, I don't know why the m_elapsed number is so huge after every clock restart

---------------- Sat, 08 Apr 23: 05:19PM

                 When I decouple the input handle part from the game constructor into a separate void Inputhandle function, the snake move as I control, but the loading symbol still exist, even though game still run but somehow not respond when I close it.But at least I know that the input handle now work.

---------------- Sun, 09 Apr 23: 11:06AM

                 I think I made it, turns out I forgot to update window class before update game in the game update , which may cause the infinite stuck in game loop.
